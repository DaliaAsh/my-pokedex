## MVC Pattern

I achieved the MVC Pattern by separating the front end from the backend and the backend is RESTFull API which serves all kind of requests from different clients by transferring JSON Data and sending the request to the same endpoint , but with different method .

## Description

Pokedex Landing Page uses fetches the data from the Restful API backend server that I built using Node JS and Express JS . The Landing Page contains four Main Parts :

## Part 1 : Header
